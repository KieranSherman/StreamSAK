## StreamSAK Plugins

As of v4.0+, you can now use plug-ins with StreamSAK!  What does this mean?  Well, let's say that you wish that StreamSAK could do more than just change a textfile.  Let's say that you want StreamSAK to also include a button that automatically prompts you for input, and then posts that input you gave to Twitter for you.  *Impossible* you might say, but fear not, with v4.0+, StreamSAK plug-ins allow you to create your own, (or download someone else's) programs which can interact with StreamSAK with limitless possibilities!

Check out the **[official releases](releases)** for currently approved/released plug-ins.



## Creating Your Own Plugins

If you're a strapping young Java programmer, and want to add more functionality to StreamSAK, then you're in the right place.  To begin, you're going to have to download the source files for the interface implementation that you'll need.  You can do that below.

**[Download StreamSAKPluginLibrary](https://github.com/ShermanZero/StreamSAK/raw/master/data/plugins/src/StreamSAKPluginLibrary.jar)**

Once you've downloaded the StreamSAKPluginLibrary.jar file, you're going to need to import it into your project and set your build path to include it.  From there, developing your plug-in is as easy as implementing one of two interfaces:

```
StreamSAKSimplePlugin
StreamSAKAdvancedPlugin
```

The **SimplePlugin** interface contains limited functionality, while the **AdvancedPlugin** interface allows more versatility with your plug-in.  However, the AdvancedPlugin interface isn't always needed if you're just trying to do something simple.  Be sure to take a look at the two basic examples I've given you for reference:

**[Simple Plug-in Example](examples/SimplePluginExample.java)**


**[Advanced Plug-in Example](examples/AdvancedPluginExample.java)**


As you can see below, both plug-ins have been imported into the program, and in order to do that, the only thing you need to do is place your .jar file(s) inside the **plugins** folder generated by StreamSAK.

*Note: When exporting your plug-in to a .jar file, make sure you export it as a runnable .jar file with a main method.  Otherwise, any dependencies you may be using will not be exported with your .jar file in a format that the plug-in loader can recognize*

Happy coding!
