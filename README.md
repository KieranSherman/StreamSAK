# StreamSAK v2.1

As a streamer, I've always looked for an elegant tool that I could use to adjust my wins/losses/draws count on the fly, without having to tab out or edit a file manually.  I never found anything, so I decided to make it myself.

Note: The program creates files to hold the data in the program location.  For example, if the jar file is in my Desktop, it will create its files in the Desktop.  I recommend placing it in a folder by itself somewhere.  Then, just set up OBS to read in text from a file, and your counter is all set up to go!
